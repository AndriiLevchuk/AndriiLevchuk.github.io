						The award winning 3.6 hectare vineyard overlooks the village of <b>Burnham Market</b> on the <b>North Norfolk Coast.</b></p>
					<p>
						Owned and managed by the Perowne family, the south facing, chalk strata land is ideal land for vines and has been a dream of the family for decades. The first grapes were planted in Spring 2016 and the first Bacchus was harvested in Autumn 2019 and bottled in May 2020. The grape varieties being grown are Bacchus, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. </p>
 					<p>
 						In 2019, Cobble Hill bottled 4,000 litres of pink sparkling wine with pinot noir grapes which will be available in 2021. </p>
 					<p>
 						The Bacchus 2019 vintage is now available in local shops and restaurants and the 2020 harvest of Bacchus, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir will take place in Autumn 2020.</p>
